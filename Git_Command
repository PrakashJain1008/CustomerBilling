Git command

git init - to initialize the .git folder at targeted location

git status - to check the status of git files

git add --a - to add all files at staging area 

git commit -m "comment for commit" - after adding files/file at staging area do commit to add afterwards in remote repository

git remote add origin URL - to add origin 

git branch -M branch_name (master/name) - to set the branch 

git push -u origin master (branch_name)  - To push the repository into branch location.

git restore "file_name" -- discard the changes in the file 

git restore --staged  "file name"  -- to unstage the file which have staged earlier. 

		restoring here in git is quite possible or I could say its very easy but to make changes like deletion of file and rename the file manually at
		file location itself is also easier than to make it in git .

git diff -- when we have to track the status of staging area and working area changes.

git diff HEAD   -- To check difference between last commit i.e. at remote repository and working area.

git add --a and do again git diff head and then see the result.

Yes got the point, if in between I add file in staging area then also it will show diff between 
what was my last update and what is current update including the staging area.

git diff HEAD HEAD^  ---last commit and previous to last commit (difference) head -1.

git diff master origin/master   --- difference between local master and origin master it shows.
